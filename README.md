### This website allows customers to:

    - Create and manage their accounts
    - Manage their list of vehicles
    - Book appointments online based on the garage's availability
</br>

### The website also includes an admin panel for the shop manager with the following features:

    - Manage the schedule by adjusting the number of available appointments each day (e.g., two appointments on one day, none the next).
    - Edit the list of services offered to customers for online booking.
    - Review pending appointments to approve or decline them, with access to customer contact details if needed.
    - Update garage information, such as opening hours, phone number, etc.


When a customer books an appointment, the garage is notified via email, and the same happens if a customer cancels an appointment.

When the garage approves or declines an appointment, the customer is also notified by email.
